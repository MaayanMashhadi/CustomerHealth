### AI Collaboration Evidence

1. **AI Tools Used**

   * **Claude** : Assisted in creating unit tests for all REST API endpoints, including edge cases for invalid event types and missing required fields.
   * **ChatGPT** : Helped design and implement API endpoints, including database interaction logic and HTML templating for dashboards.
2. **Quality of Research and Implementation Decisions**

   * Used AI suggestions to structure endpoints in FastAPI, handle error cases, and apply templating logic.
   * Incorporated best practices recommended by AI for database interactions, input validation, and modular code design.

**Summary:** AI tools were leveraged as **collaboration partners** to speed up development, validate logic, and generate high-quality tests, while final decisions and implementation adjustments were made by the developer.
